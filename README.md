#  Machine Learning Project – ESSCA Budapest 2024

This repository contains the final Machine Learning project completed as part of the course **T1508M/T1608M – Introduction to Machine Learning** at **ESSCA Budapest** (Spring 2024).


##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to act as a **data analyst** and apply machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset. This includes:

- Defining a clear problem (classification, regression, or clustering)
- Preprocessing and analyzing the data
- Implementing and comparing multiple ML algorithms
- Evaluating model performance and refining results

## Project Structure

###  Problem Statement  
We defined the business context and identified the type of problem being solved

###  Data Loading  
We loaded the dataset, described its structure, and summarized its features (columns, types, and target variable).

### Data Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values  
- Scaled numerical features  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Applied relevant feature engineering

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
We performed data exploration to uncover key insights, trends, and correlations using:
- Summary statistics  
- Histograms, pairplots, heatmaps, etc.  
- Feature importance analysis

### Model Development  
We implemented and trained multiple machine learning models:
- [Model 1: e.g., Decision Tree Classifier]  
- [Model 2: e.g., Random Forest Classifier]  
- [Model 3: optional / bonus: e.g., XGBoost, Logistic Regression]

###  Model Evaluation  
Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Confusion matrix  
- ROC Curve / Cross-validation where relevant  
We compared the performance of each model and selected the best one.

###  Model Refinement & Conclusion  
We presented findings and insights drawn from the models, discussed their strengths and limitations, and suggested potential improvements or future work.

##  Technologies Used
